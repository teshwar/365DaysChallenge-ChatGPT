        <h1>Introduction to Web Development</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the world of web development! This is a basic HTML page to introduce you to some fundamental concepts.
        </p>
        <h2>Client-Server Architecture</h2>
        <p>
            The web operates on a client-server architecture, where clients (such as web browsers) request resources from servers (which host websites). This interaction is facilitated by the HTTP protocol.
        </p>
        <h2>Front-End vs. Back-End Development</h2>
        <p>
            Front-end development involves building the user interface and interactions that users see and interact with in their web browsers. Back-end development, on the other hand, involves building and maintaining the server-side logic and databases that power web applications.
