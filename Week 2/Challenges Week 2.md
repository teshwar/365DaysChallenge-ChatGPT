Week 2: Data Structures and Algorithms
8. Day 8: Lists and List Comprehensions

    Perform various operations on lists.
    Use list comprehensions to generate new lists.

    Day 9: Tuples and Sets
        Explore tuple operations and immutability.
        Perform set operations and eliminate duplicates from a list using sets.

    Day 10: Sorting Algorithms
        Implement basic sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort).
        Compare their time complexity.

    Day 11: Searching Algorithms
        Implement linear and binary search algorithms.
        Analyze their time complexity.

    Day 12: Recursion
        Solve a problem using recursion.
        Discuss the concept of recursion and base cases.

    Day 13: Data Structures (Stacks and Queues)
        Implement a stack and a queue.
        Solve a problem using these data structures.

    Day 14: Advanced List Manipulation
        Use advanced list manipulation techniques (slicing, zip, enumerate).
        Solve a problem that involves nested lists.
